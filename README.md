# Hi :wave:, I'm Bijay :man_technologist:

I'm a MERN and MEAN Stack developer. I am passionate about everything related to javascript.
Technologies I enjoy working on includes react, angular, css, nodejs, mongodb and docker. My favourite IDE is Webstorm.

I love talking to people, making new friends. If you would also like to connect with me then follow me [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bijay_ps)
or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bijay-prakash-singh/)

When I am not coding am either reading a book :books: or binge watching some series :smiley:

If you want to glimpse what's going on inside my brain, then take a look at my blog [litthoughts](https://litthoughts.in/)
