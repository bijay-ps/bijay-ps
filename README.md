# Hi :wave:, I'm Bijay :man_technologist:

I'm a MERN and MEAN Stack developer. I am passionate about everything related to javascript.
Technologies I enjoy working on includes react, angular, css, nodejs, mongodb and docker. My favourite IDE is Webstorm.

I love talking to people, making new friends.

When I am not coding am either reading a book :books: or binge watching some series :smiley:
